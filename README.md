Visualization of the shortest path using A-star and Dijkstra algorithms
Real-time path generation between two chosen points

To start, run the gui/main_window.py file.

To run a benchmark comparing time of both algorithms, run benchmark.py

Keys:\
change algorithm - A\
barrier - B\
empty - E\
restart - R\
start - right mouse\
target - left mouse\
start pathfinding - Space (after start and target are set up)

After the path is found, left mouse btn and right mouse btn are used to move the target and the start.
